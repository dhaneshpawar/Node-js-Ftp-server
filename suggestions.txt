user should be able to send friend request to someone is in the liked by section of 
any of his friends post 

that means if the user click on the name of the user which on the post , he will be
directly able to see his profile 
but if the user click on the name of the user in the likes section 
then we have to first check that is he friend of this logged in user or not 
if yes then show its profile,
and if no then directly take the user to the friends page , 
insert the name of that person into search box automatically  
and show the user that person as a search result.

show
"sorry , something went wrong , click here to back to the main page "
this message when someone enters url other than we needed , handle that situation in vue
and dont's allow any request through url instead of index 
 
that is in nodejs 
there will be only one url request to return a page and that will be the index page 

if user make any other request like home and other urls he will get another error 
because those urls that come into the url bar, we are not going to define them 
we are going to define separate urls for ajax request and even if hacker made
those request from the browser he will get only json data and in it there will 
be only client encrypted ids
